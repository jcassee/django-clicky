django-clicky
-------------

The django-clicky application integrates Clicky_ analytics into a
Django_ project.

Clicky is an online web analytics tool.  It is similar to Google
Analytics in that it provides statistics on who is visiting your website
and what they are doing.  Clicky provides its data in real time and is
designed to be very easy to use.  See the ``django_clicky`` package
docstring for documentation.  The source code and issue tracker are
hosted on GitHub_.

project.
